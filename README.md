# Telegram Game of Life Bot

## Description
This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using a Telegram bot. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## How it works
In this implementation, every message sent to the group where the bot is added can start the evolution process based on some probabilities, so the evolution will not be always the same as in the basic algorithm.

## How to use
- Create bot using Botfather
- Change bot privacy in order to allow bot to read messages from groups
- Add bot to desired group
- ...
